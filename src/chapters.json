Now we are going to land on the earth after a long journey of 16 months and for a coincidence, today is my birthday and I’m 20 years now. It’s my first experience. I'm excited and nervous at the same time. I experienced this same feeling when I was 9 years old. I used to watch the night sky every day and I felt like those stars were talking to me. After school, I used to finish my homework and go out to play with my friends. After that, I used to freshen up and watch ‘Looney Toons’ with my little sister and Snoopy”</P></div>",

He used to bark at the shooting stars and I used to think he had some wish.“Mom, Mom, look, the star is flying.” She looked up and said, “Ha Ha, that’s not a flying star that is a rocket. One day I saw a bright red star that was passing by in the sky and I asked my mom about it.</p></div></div>",

            "<div class='page2-content'><div><p>Those words still ring in my mind and that is the main reason why I’m here. On one of my birthdays, my dad had gifted me a telescope and with that, I used to watch the night sky clearly. In high school, I studied constellations. I published papers about constellations and gave those papers to my English teacher. She used to keep all those papers in a file. One day I got a call from my principal’s office. I was tense. I thought he had my progress card because I had scored less in the mid exams, but he surprised me by saying that I was going to visit the NASA centre in the U.S next week. I was totally shocked.</p></div></div>",
            "<div class='page2-content'><div><p>I was excited and nervous at the same time. It was all because of my teacher. She had sent those papers to NASA through the mail after correcting some grammatical mistakes. On the first day of my internship at NASA, I found that I was the youngest to be selected there. When we reached near the Earth’s atmosphere, the Spaceship was shaking and finally, we landed. When I stepped out, there were a lot of people around and different news channels were telecasting our arrival and there were a lot of people who were taking photographs.Then I saw my family, I ran and hugged them. All the press people surrounded us and then our chief came to me and congratulated me.</p></div></div>",

One fine day, I was very tired and fell asleep during the time when Alice used to return home from school. I woke up and saw that she had some cardboard sheet in her hand and it had some numbers written on it.</p></div></div>",

Alice, show me your progress card,” said Charles. She handed over the progress report to her father. “Not a bad score. What’s wrong with these marks, “Lisa”? , asked Charles.” “Whaaat? Do you think these are good scores? She is ranked 10th in her class, Charles and you think it’s ok?” A quarrel started between the parents Lisa blamed it on me.</p></div></div>",

Then Alice came over to me and took me for a walk but she looked really sad. I tried making her happy but it didn’t work and we returned home. Alice, Charles and I went on a ride in the car and this was my first experience in a car. I really enjoyed it. It was pouring outside and after some time, the car stopped. We got down and they took me along with them.</p></div></div>",

I didn’t know what was going on and they went away leaving me behind. That was the last time I ever saw her. I spent my life like other street dogs and I befriended a dog, his name is Bruno.We used to have a great time together. One day there were many dogs barking on the streets and suddenly some men with ropes attached to sticks in their hands started approaching us.</p></div></div>",

I was severely injured and it was raining. I ran alongside the truck but it got away. I was exhausted and fell on the road. I was unable to move and tears rolled down my furry cheeks and it felt like it was my last day and that I was going to die. There was a vehicle coming towards me and I was unable to move an inch, I gave up and closed my eyes.</p></div></div>",

A few days later I was in the hospital garden as I was getting trained under some men. A Man came to the garden while I was playing. A crowd escalated around him quickly and they were clicking photos with him. He came towards me and said, “Hey bro, how you doing?”</p></div></div>",
            "<div class='page2-content'><div><p>“His Voice!!! He is the one who saved me,” I recognised. I jumped onto him and started kissing him.

The people who surrounded him asked him a question. “Mr.Vicky, you are an astronaut and you are very young, you earn a lot of money and you can put this money in helping the poor rather than wasting money by constructing hospitals for animals and appointing doctors for them?” He replied with a smile, “Humans can get help from other humans but Animals? They can't survive on their own and that’s why I am going to adopt all the abandoned dogs and I will take care of each one of them.”</p></div></div>",

The following day, the countries were going to compromise and stop the war. Orders were passed to halt the war and everything seemed soundless. But a group of Pakistani soldiers were not happy with the compromise and tried to attack again. They attacked the area and captured my father and other soldiers.</p></div></div>",

He just lived a common man's life, working 9 to 5 and spending time with the family.
